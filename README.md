# Government Sample Website

A comprehensive, modern, and accessible government website template built with Next.js and shadcn/ui components. This project serves as a reference implementation for government entities looking to modernize their digital presence while adhering to accessibility standards and providing a superior user experience.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project demonstrates a modern approach to building government websites with a focus on:

- **User-Centric Design**: Prioritizing the citizen's needs with intuitive navigation and clear information architecture
- **Accessibility**: Ensuring the website is usable by people of all abilities in accordance with WCAG guidelines
- **Multilingual Support**: Built-in language switching capabilities to serve diverse populations
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized experience across all device types from mobile to desktop
- **Performance**: Fast loading times and optimized rendering for a smooth user experience
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Respect for user preferences with automatic and manual theme switching
- **Document Translation**: English to Hindi translation service for government documents

## üåê Document Translation Service

The project includes a powerful English-Hindi translation service specifically designed for government documents. This feature leverages a custom machine learning model trained on government terminology to provide accurate translations.

### Translation Features

- **Specialized for Government Documents**: Specifically trained on bureaucratic language and formal tone
- **Preserves Technical Terms**: Accurately translates specialized government terminology
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple input/output design for ease of use
- **Customizable Model**: Trainable with domain-specific translation pairs
- **Self-hosted Solution**: No dependency on external APIs or services

### How To Use The Translation Service

1. **Start the Translation Server**:
   ```bash
   cd python-api
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Launch the Translation Interface**:
   ```bash
   cd python-api
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Translate Documents**:
   - Enter English text in the input field
   - Click "Translate" to get Hindi translation
   - Copy the translated text for use in documents

### Training The Translation Model

The translation system uses a custom model that can be trained with domain-specific terminology:

1. **Prepare Training Data**:
   - Create a CSV file with "english,hindi" columns
   - Add translation pairs relevant to your government domain
   - Alternatively, use the provided sample data in `govt_training_data.csv`

2. **Train the Model**:
   ```bash
   cd python-api
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. **Test Your Translation Quality**:
   - After training, the model will automatically test with some example phrases
   - Check translation quality and add more training data as needed

### Translation API Endpoints

For developers integrating the translation service:

- **POST /translate**: Translate English text to Hindi
  ```json
  {"text": "Your English text here", "preserve_formatting": true}
  ```

- **POST /train/add-data**: Add new training data pairs
  ```json
  {"training_pairs": [{"english": "English text", "hindi": "Hindi translation"}]}
  ```

- **GET /health**: Check API status and model information
